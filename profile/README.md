# loathers

We are a group of Kingdom of Loathing players (and hooked ex-players) writing scripts and other tools to benefit the player community.

We produce new scripts and also look after old scripts that are no longer maintained. We exclusively make new scripts using TypeScript, but still maintain a number of "legacy" ASH projects, some of which have no intention of moving over.

We are new players, older players, members of the /dev team, contributors to [KoLmafia](https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia) and many more things.

We hang out in the [Ascension Speed Society Discord](https://discord.gg/j7w6We2vGF) - come and say hi!
